# smilebasic-theme.el
An Emacs theme based on the code editor in the 3DS software SmileBASIC.

SmileBoom provides the fonts the editor uses [here](http://smilebasic.com/en/supplements/), so you can use them in Emacs. However they are outline-only, so you have to add bitmap strikes to them using FontForge or similar to get true bitmap rendering.
